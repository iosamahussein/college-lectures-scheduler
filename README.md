# College Lectures Scheduler

## Description
The College Lectures Scheduler is a web application designed to facilitate the creation of schedules for college lectures. This project helps streamline the process of organizing and managing lecture timetables efficiently. Users can easily create, view, and modify schedules, ensuring that there are no conflicts in instructor availability or room bookings.

## Features

### Lecture Schedule Table
The heart of the application is the interactive schedule table. Users can easily visualize and plan lectures based on various parameters such as time, room, and instructor availability. The schedule table also includes features to prevent scheduling conflicts, ensuring the integrity of the timetable.

### Conflict Prevention
To enhance the scheduling process, the application incorporates conflict prevention measures. For instance, the system prevents the addition of an instructor to a lecture if they are already scheduled for another lecture at the same time. Additionally, it checks for conflicts in room availability to avoid double bookings.

### Admin Panel
The admin panel provides a centralized location for administrators to manage information about instructors. Admins can add, edit, or remove details related to instructors, ensuring that the system stays up-to-date with the latest faculty information.
